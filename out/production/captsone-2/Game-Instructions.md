## Game Instructions
You start out with a character select screen by having 15 characters that represent the 15 main line Final Fantasy games.
Each character has their own stats, attacks, magic, limit breaker, and defensive moves. You are then thrown into an encounter
with a monster that are staple within the Final Fantasy franchise. You can check the stats in the menu bar or read these instructions.
From here, you fight the monster to either defeat it or have it defeat you. If your health comes lower than 25%, you can use your special attack.
