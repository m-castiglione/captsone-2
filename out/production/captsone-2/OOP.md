Object Oriented Programming Concept Questions

As you should know by now, there are 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming.

********************
1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation refers to the gathering of data that has methods that operate on it.
Encapsulation is defined in programming by abstract modules or data types in which hides data or values from the user.
To retrieve said data, you need "Getters" and to use the data you need "Setters".







********************
2. Inheritance
Inheritance is the ability of an object to take one or more attributes from other classes or objects. When an object is inherited, it becomes a subclass.
The subclass can modify the behavior of a parent class by adding new attributes or methods or modifying existing ones.







********************
1. Abstraction
Abstraction refers to the technique of hiding complexity of methods or classes. 
It is used to reduce complexity by removing unnecessary information. By making things more simplified, developers can have easier access and manage the objects. 







********************
1. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability to appear as different forms. More technically, it refers to the ability to process different objects with the same name but with different parameters.
This is essentially a redefining methods and derived classes.   






Please write a 1-3 paragraphs explaining these 4 concepts further.  Please provide a sufficient enough explanation about these pillars, as well as some examples to illustrate the practical use cases of these principles.
