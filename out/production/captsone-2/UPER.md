* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*I am making a Final Fantasy inspired RPG battle game. You choose a character which has different stats and abilities and you go on to face a random enemy as that character.
The character's stats are comprised of an attack value (strength), a defense value (toughness), a magic value (intelligence), a special ability, a limit gauge (critical), a health gauge, and a magic gauge.
*The enemy has an attack value, a defense value, and health.

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* I plan on using an abstract class for the help menu item button which explains the game's instructions. From there, I will use JFrame and JPanels to create the game.
First the character create frame will have 15 buttons for 15 different characters to choose from. From there, I plan on getting the character and removing the character select 
screen and show the battle screen, which is the main game. There a random monster will appear and you have to fight it. You can use your main attack, magic, special ability or defend.
