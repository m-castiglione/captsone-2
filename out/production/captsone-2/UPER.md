<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*I am making a Final Fantasy inspired RPG battle game. You choose a character which has different stats and abilities and you go on to face a random enemy as that character.
The character's stats are comprised of an attack value (strength), a defense value (toughness), a magic value (intelligence), a special ability, a limit gauge (critical), a health gauge, and a magic gauge.
*The enemy has an attack value, a defense value, and health.

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* I will use JFrame and JPanels to create the game.
First the character create frame will have 15 buttons for 15 different characters to choose from. From there, I plan on getting the character and removing the character select 
screen and show the battle screen, which is the main game. There a random monster will appear and you have to fight it. You can use your main attack, magic, special ability or defend.

    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*Upon building the game, the panels started to give me a lot of trouble with the different layouts. I still managed to get it to look as best it could.
There is a lot of tedium with creating the hero classes and giving them abstraction. I made a random number generator to determine which monster you encounter.
*I did get some help which led me to the idea of making each hero a class and the same with enemies. However, when trying to implement the enemies, my game started to produce adverse results.

    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*I wish I had more knowledge and understanding in Java to make the code a bit prettier but this is the best I could come up with.
